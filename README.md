# PuppeteerCrawler project

This template is a production ready boilerplate for developing with `PuppeteerCrawler`. Use this to bootstrap your projects using the most up-to-date code.

> We decided to split Apify SDK into two libraries, [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev) and [Apify SDK v3](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js). Crawlee will retain all the crawling and scraping-related tools and will always strive to be the best web scraping library for its community. At the same time, Apify SDK will continue to exist, but keep only the Apify-specific features related to building actors on the Apify platform. Read the [upgrading guide](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/docs/upgrading/upgrading-to-v3) to learn about the changes.

Via NPM
Node Version > 16.0.0

In Linux: sudo npm -g install apify-cli
